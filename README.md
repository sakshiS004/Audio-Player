# Audio-Player<br>
**Overview:** <br>
The `Audio` Java application allows users to play, stop, reset, and quit audio playback of a `.wav` file using a command-line interface. 
It uses the `javax.sound.sampled` package for audio operations.

**Key Point:** <br>
Use .wav for the audio file, as `javax.sound.sampled` primarily supports this format and has limited support for other extensions.
