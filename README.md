# Audio-Player<br>
**Overview: <br>
The `Audio` Java application allows users to play, stop, reset, and quit audio playback of a `.wav` file using a command-line interface. 
It uses the `javax.sound.sampled` package for audio operations.

**Key Point: <br>
Use '.wav' for the audio file as `javax.sound.sampled` does not support mp3 any other extension.
